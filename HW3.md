# Data story
As a group, identify interesting data that is available via an API. Then, your task in this homework is to pull that data into Google Cloud using the API, use SQL to create new tables from the data that are amenable to visualization, and then create a dashboard of your visualizations and analyis using [Data Studio](https://datastudio.google.com/).

For example, a previous group once gathered data from two APIs to assess if a rise in Covid cases coincided with a drop in carbon intensity in the air in the UK. Here is an [example notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1141GiuXtlBC0aYrsuhvnoOKEKH93m4b-?usp=sharing) (note that the Data Studio dashboard linked in this notebook is not available as it requires the use of tables hosted in Google Cloud which rely on credits that have been exhausted).

## Project deliverables
* Submit a colaboratory notebook telling the story of why that data is of interest to your group, explain your choice of API, your process for extracting and transforming the data, as well as provide the link to your Data Studio dashboard and to all of the tables that the dashboard relies upon (stored in Google Cloud). 
* Utilization of data includes points for groups which produce easily reproducible projects. That is, projects which anyone in the class can open and begin modifying to answer variations on questions that were asked.
* After the projects have been graded, groups will be invited to share their notebooks with the class by providing the link. This is voluntary. The shared notebooks will be available as an internal blog for the class to use to learn from.
